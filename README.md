# Simple Calculator
- TOP Foundations Course Calculator Project

Shoutout to WebDevSimplified and his video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw) which was my reference for the project. I couldn't fully grasp all of it, especially the one where he uses Classes (I don't think I'm at that part yet where TOP discussed it), but overall I still learned plenty from this tutorial - which was the best JS Calculator tutorial I found. The frontend was all me though :3, I enjoyed working on this all afternoon.

Key features:
- Vanilla JavaScript Calculator coded primarily using Classes(?)
- Evaluates a single pair of numbers at a time, before handling the next operation
- Displays current and previous (evaluated) operand
- Formats larger numbers with a comma (,)

Some features I (~ChatGPT) added:
- Keyboard support
- Basic error handling (Division by zero, invalid input)
